**Neuron-specific WWOX gene therapy produces dose-dependent, durable rescue in a model of
WWOX-related encephalopathy** · PMCID from local PMC HTML · Aqeilan laboratory, with
Berent and Brennan among the authors.

🟡 **PARTIAL READ of 2026-08-10 — declared partial deliberately.** Abstract, the therapeutic-
window section and the **entire Discussion** were read in full. Introduction, the seven
results sections, Materials and Methods and all figures were **not** read. The reading was
stopped where care could no longer be guaranteed, not where the material ran out.

This supersedes nothing: the only prior record, `FTR-20260726-42422765-01`, is a
`legacy_reconstruction` whose source locator is `paper_registry_current.md#PAPER 011` — the
registry, not the article. Its coverage map is `unknown_legacy` in every section. **No reading
of this paper had ever taken place.**

## Why this paper, and what it settles

Read immediately after `PMID 34747138` because it is the direct continuation: Repudi 2021 gave
a single dose at P0 and left the window open as its largest unknown. This paper is the dose-
response and timing study, from the same laboratory, four years later.

### 🔴 It fires the REVIVAL_TRIGGER recorded yesterday

The trigger written into the 34747138 record was: *a post-natal dosing experiment in this
model would change the reading of the whole paper.* It exists, and it is here.

**1.**
> "neuronal WWOX restoration using the high-dose vector at any time point between P0 and P5 was sufficient to fully rescue the Wwox-null phenotype"

`surface: body` · Results, 'Early postnatal WWOX gene therapy achieves durable therapeutic
rescue'. With the magnitude:
> "a dramatic extension in survival, from approximately three weeks to nearly one year"

**2.** 🔴 **And the paper explicitly refuses to read its own ceiling as biology.**
> "Therapeutic rescue beyond this early postnatal window was not explored, as Wwox-null mice rapidly deteriorate with progressive neurological dysfunction and early lethality"

> "the inability to assess later intervention likely reflects a combination of model-specific biological constraints and technical limitations, rather than a definitive boundary for therapeutic responsiveness"

> "human patients with WWOX-related encephalopathies may exhibit different developmental trajectories, disease kinetics, and therapeutic responsiveness, potentially allowing for later intervention"

`surface: body` · Discussion, window paragraph.

**This is the epistemically correct form of a negative and it should be recorded as a model
of one.** The absence of data beyond P5 is caused by the mouse dying, not by the therapy
failing. A system that files "window = P0–P5" as a fact would have manufactured a false
negative of exactly the kind [[epistemic_discipline]] describes — silent, permanent, self-
reinforcing. The correct entry is: **efficacy demonstrated P0–P5; upper bound unknown and
unmeasurable in this model.** `PREMISE: DEFAULT_FROM_TEXTBOOK` would have been the trap —
"gene therapy needs an early window" is true elsewhere and is not established here.

**3.** The authors name what would extend it:
> "future studies should explore alternative strategies to extend the therapeutic window, including earlier prenatal delivery, less invasive or systemic administration routes"

### What it settles about oligodendrocytes — and what it does not

Yesterday's paper attributed its residual myelin deficit to a possible oligodendrocyte-
autonomous WWOX function. This paper tests that directly, with an MBP-driven vector, and it
fails — but the authors refuse the easy conclusion:

**4.**
> "may reflect the limited oligodendrocyte tropism of AAV9 following neonatal ICV administration rather than a lack of relevance for oligodendrocyte WWOX expression"

> "We also cannot exclude that the optimal dose was not achieved, as all vectors were tested at the same titer (4E10)"

`surface: body` · Discussion. 🔴 **A failed rescue by a vector with poor tropism for the target
cell is not evidence that the target cell does not matter.** The question yesterday's reading
raised stays open, and this paper says so itself.

**5.** The independent genetic evidence for neuronal sufficiency is conditional-KO, not this
vector series:
> "deletion of Wwox in neural stem/progenitor cells (Nestin-Cre) or postmitotic neurons (Synapsin I-Cre) recapitulated the severe neurological and metabolic phenotypes of global KO mice, whereas astrocyte- (GFAP-Cre) or oligodendrocyte-specific (Olig2-Cre) deletion produced no overt abnormalities"

`surface: body` · Discussion, citing reference 42. Against the paper's own headline:
> "neuronal WWOX expression is both necessary and sufficient for survival and CNS homeostasis, whereas expression in oligodendrocytes alone is insufficient to confer benefit"

### Vector design and its declared limits

**6.**
> "we removed WPRE as a proactive risk-mitigation step to improve the predictability and control of neuronal WWOX expression for potential clinical translation"

`surface: body` · Discussion. Removed **pre-emptively**, not after observed toxicity —
efficacy was then recovered by dose.

**7.** The limitation the authors state about their own promoter comparison:
> "a limitation of our study is that WWOX expression levels were not normalized across promoter conditions"

**8.** And about the electrophysiology:
> "Although conducted in a limited cohort, these findings support the capacity of WWOX gene therapy to correct epileptiform activity at its developmental onset"

## What this does to yesterday's two readings

| yesterday | today |
|---|---|
| 34747138: P0 only, window declared the largest unknown | **P1–P5 works; the ceiling is the model's, not the therapy's** |
| 34747138: residual myelin deficit attributed to possible oligodendrocyte-autonomous function | **tested and failed — but by a vector with poor tropism for that cell, so the question is open, not closed** |
| 34747138: reviewer objection "no evidence for absence in the PNS", unquotable | this paper has sciatic-nerve and spinal-cord sections in its Methods — **unread here**, and the obvious place to look |

## Reading debt this leaves — explicit and large

- **Introduction, all seven results sections, Materials and Methods, and every figure: not
  read.** The dose-response curves, the P0–P5 survival data (Figure S8), the
  electrophysiology (Figure 7) and the myelination quantification (Figure 6) are all
  *reported* above from the running text and **not verified against their panels**. Given that
  three papers in a row have carried a finding visible only in a panel, this debt is the
  largest single risk in the current state.
- **Supplementary Figure S8 carries the entire window result** and has not been seen.
- The **PNS question** from yesterday's refused review file has a candidate answer in this
  paper's Methods. Unread.
